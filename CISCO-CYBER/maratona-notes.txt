Anotações da primeira matarona de Cybersegurança da CISCO. 

Type of threats: internal and external, such as, respectivally, ex-employees and staff/ amateurs, white & grey & black hats,
hacktivists. 

Users are the most weak link of security (duh, humans). Don't have awareness of security, security policies (and not using them),
data stolen, unauthorized downloads&media, unauthorized vpn, websites, and so on.

Open computers and softwares from thid-party with no security are threats, and lack of updates(software and hardware, research for
the threats for each situation) and policies for security too.

For LAN: 

  - Unauthorized acess
  - exploits of data in transit
  - misconfigured firewalls
  - rogue users having unauthorized acess
  - software or network vulnerabilities that comes with a lack of updates

For private cloud: (RFN means router firewall network)

  - Unauthorized acess to resources
  - Unauthorized network probind and port scanning 
  - Vulnerabilies from software or hardware in RFN
  - COnfiguration errors on hardware for RFN
  - REmote users acess to data

For public cloud:

  - 3 models used by organizations: 
  
    -- Saas:  subscription-based model that provides organizations with software that is centrally hosted and accessed by users via a web browser, app or other software. In other words, this is software not stored locally but in the cloud. 
    -- Paas: develop, run and manage applications on the service hardware, using tools privided by the service. Also runs on cloud.
    -- Iaas: provides virtual computing resources such as hardware, software, servers and other infraestructure componentes over the internet.
    An org. will buy the acess and use the public cloud to acess them.

Most common threats to public cloud:
 - Data breaches
 - Loss or theft of intellectual property
 - Comprimised credentiais or account hijacking
 - Social engineering attacks
 - Compliance violation (violação de um acordo ou conformidade entre partes)

Examples of threats to an organization’s physical facilities domain include:

   - Natural threats such as extreme weather and geological hazards.
   - Someone gaining unauthorized access to the premises.
   - Power interruptions or outages.
   - Social engineering attacks that attempt to find out about an organization’s security policies and procedures.
   - Breaches of electronic perimeter defenses.
   - Theft.
   - An unlocked data center.
   - A lack of surveillance on the premises.

Application domain includes all of the critical systems, applications and data used for support of operations. Some applications, such as email and
database management, is going to the cloud on actual days.

Common threats to applications:

- Someone gaining unauthorized acess to data centers, computer rooms, wiring closets or/AND systems.
- Server downtime during maintenance periods
- Network operating system software vulnerabilities.
- Data loss.
- Client-server or web application devel. vulnerabilities.

Software vulnerabilities is result of programming mistakes, protocol vunerabilities, or system misconfigurations.

Commom software vulnerabilities attacks are:

- ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREAT(APT): Continuous attack that uses espionage tactics involving multiple actors, and/or sophisticated malware to analyze and gain acess to a target network.
Occurs from under the radar, with long periods of time. Targets are high-level orgs and goverments, and the attacks are well-funded and planned.

- Algorithm attacks take advantage of algorithms in a piece of legitimate software to generate unintended behaviours, like trigger false alarms or
overload the CPU or RAM.

Threat intelligence data (for study of attacks like this). There is private source data (pay to have acess to that data), or open source intelligence data
(OSINT, free to acess data).

Backdoor is malware used to gain unauthorized acess to a system bypassing the normal authentication procedures. Some examples are Netbus and Back Orifice.
Normal usage is that authorized users, unknowingly, run a remote administrative tool (RAT) on their machine to install a backdoor that gives to the criminal administative control over a target computer.

Rootkits is malware designed to modify the operating system to create a backdoor, which attackers can use to acess the computer remotely. They take advantages of software vulnerabilities to gain acess to resources that shoudn't be acessible(privilege escallation) and modify system files.
Can also modify system tools and forensic analysis.

United States Computer Emergency Resources (US-CERT), create a dictionary of Common vulnerabilities and exposures(CVE). Each CVE entry has a standard identifier number, a brief discription of the security vulnerability, and any important references to related vunerability reports. The CVE list is on
MITRE corp website.
Other sources are the dark web, indicators of comprimise (IOC)[malware signatures, domain names], automated indicator sharing (AIS), by CISA, uses STIX and TAXII.


Social engineering attempts to manipulate individuals into performing actions or divulging confidential information. Exploits human nature, taking
advantage of peoples help, or their weakness.

Types of social engineering:

- Pretexting
- Quid pro quo
- Identity fraud

Tactics of social engineering:

- Authority (more likely to comply when instructed by someone they perceive as an authority)
- Intimidation
- Consensus
- Scarcity
- Urgency
- Familiarity
- Trust

Shoulder surfing = look one person do something and be there looking to see important data or other things.

Dumpster diving = look thought thrown out information.

Impersonation = Pretend to be someone, and trick someone.

Hoax = Act intended to deceive or trick someone.
